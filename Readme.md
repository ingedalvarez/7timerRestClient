7Timer! is a meteorological forecast service developed to assist astronomical observation. 
It was inspired by Attilla Danko's Clear Sky Chart which provides a similar service for North America. 
7Timer! is based on the products generated by the NCEP GFS model. 
The service is developed and managed by Quanzhi Ye with the help of many. 
It has been running since July 2005.

The 7timer! service is provided as-is. Feel free to use it as you like. 
There is no need to ask me for permission if you want to put the forecast graph on your website or 
use the data for your software (free or paid). I would certainly appreciate a note if you like it, 
or if you have any suggestions or comments. Note that development has long ceased because 
I have lost the luxury of having abundant free time (lives...), but I try to keep it running 
as long and stable as I can.
